	<h1>Final Proposal</h1>
	<h2> Abstract </h2>
	<p>
		Create a text-based adventure game with 3 different major narratives. The game will have the player encounter a group of underwater beings while exploring a cave. and be enhanced using css animation, javascript, and limited graphics. Will create a companion website detailing the process of making the game. 
	</p>

	<h2> Full Description </h2>
	<p>
		
<br> I'm going to be creating a text-based fantasy/adventure game that can be played in-browser. The game will have four constant characters who make up the main 'crew' with which you will interact, and the setting- an underwater DnD dungeon-type cave, followed by two secondary locations- will remain the same in all versions of the game. However, at the start of playthrough, you will be prompted to play as one of three characters. Depending on who is chosen, the player unlocks a different narrative, and can cultivate different relationships with the four constant characters. The three playable characters will include a human, an explorer, and the cousin of one of the constant characters. There will be romance options in all three routes; in the human's route it's part of the narrative, but for the other two routes it's opt-in, so you can play without having to romance anyone. <br>
<br> The game itself will be created mainly through the use of javascript, with prompts and choices, in a similar format as my JavaScript project. I will create several visuals for the game that will be implemented using css. This will include the page background, which will be an underwater shot, the cursor, which will be a sea creature, the icon (most likely the same image as the cursor), and a mini clickable icons of the main characters that will be hyperlinks to my homepage and other places you can find my art/content. If time allows and I can figure out the coding for it, I might also make character sprites of each constant character (with expressions for shock, sadness, laughter, etc. as required) and have them appear at the appropriate times within the narrative. This part will be saved for last, because I'm unsure if I'll have the time to do it, and as of right now I don't know how to implement it. I will also use css to include simple text animation, like fade in animations as the text loads. In addition, I'm currently learning how to make game music, so if possible, I will also include (opt-in) background music, and edit the widget so it fits the aesthetic of the rest of the page. If I can't figure out how to make my own music, I will most likely just link a youtube playlist. <br>
<br> The game will be accompanied by a separate webpage titled "The Making of [Game Name]". This page will have a short description of the game, a link to play it, and a surface explanation of how I made the game. It will be structured similarly to my grid project, with a gallery of the artwork made for the game, process videos of said artwork being created, and explanations of what software/etc. I used to be able to create it, so that other people can create similar games if they're so inclined! <br>
<br> The intended audience is those who like text-based fantasy/adventure games, and those who might be interested in making something similar. <br>
<br> I'm a little apprehensive about the size of this project, but I've structured several aspects so as not to make this final too overwhelming. I've already made a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game for this class, as well as a process page, so I will be building onto code I've worked with before instead of starting from complete scratch. In addition, in the case that I don't have enough time to make character sprites or to include music for the game, the nature of a text-based game allows so that this won't detract from the final product, and instead the inclusion of these aspects will only be bonuses. <br>

      <h1> Conceptober 2020</h1>
      <p> Conceptober is an art challenge spanning October, with different prompts assigned to each day of the month. It was created by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/melosprout/" target="_blank"> @melosprout </a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nirryc/" target="_blank"> @nirryc </a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nuvodraws/" target="_blank"> @nuvodraws </a>.
      <br>
      All art seen here was created by me (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/meza_creates/" target="_blank">@meza_creates</a>), with the exception of the background for Day 24 (Greek God). Day 24 was a collab between myself and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cramvisualz/" target="_blank"> @cramvisualz</a>.
